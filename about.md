**<font size="6">Alessandro Bonecchi</font>**

My name is Alessandro Bonecchi, and I specialize in programming and hardware design ideation. I am a co-founder, CEO, and CFO of RCDB. 
As for my initial vision for the company, I have been driving hobby-grade RC cars for a little over eleven years at this time, and have won multiple races in several classes on the regional level in Northern California. 
When racing RC cars, there can be many hassles involved, and as a veteran RC racer, I offer my past experience and knowledge gained to the fold of RCDB, helping the company to better address market demand. 
I am currently a rising senior in high school and am looking to continue this venture well into my time at a university, ensuring that the dream of a fully-featured RC racing and performance outfit is never thrown to the wayside.

My name is Antonio O’Hara and I specialize in hardware design and manufacturing. 
I am a co-founder, COO, and CTO of RCDB. I first started in on-road RC racing six years ago, making my own parts from the very beginning. 
On road RC then led me into RC fixed wing aircraft and first person view quadcopters which helped hone my skills. Since then, I have excelled with designing and implementing 3D printed composites into RC. 
I have also found great success in affordably reproducing and improving OEM RC parts. Currently a rising sophomore in high school, I can see myself continuing to design and produce RC parts.

My name is Edward O’Hara and I specialize in CAD design and marketing. 
I am a co-founder, CMO, and CXO of RCDB. My brother introduced me to RC, which led to me designing and modifying my RC cars. 
I continued to spiral into the rabbit hole of RC for several years and have accumulated a collection of RC trucks and custom-built drones. 
Eventually, I earned myself a position as an intern at an IT company, where I developed marketing skills, as well as my knowledge of business. 
I am a rising freshman in high school and have taken and will continue to take numerous courses on the intricacies of business.
