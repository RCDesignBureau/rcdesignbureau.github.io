**<font size="6">Alessandro Bonecchi</font>**

My name is Alessandro Bonecchi, and I specialize in programming and hardware design ideation. I am a co-founder, CEO, and CFO of RCDB. 
As for my initial vision for the company, I have been driving hobby-grade RC cars for a little over eleven years at this time, and have won multiple races in several classes on the regional level in Northern California. 
When racing RC cars, there can be many hassles involved, and as a veteran RC racer, I offer my past experience and knowledge gained to the fold of RCDB, helping the company to better address market demand. 
I am currently a rising senior in high school and am looking to continue this venture well into my time at a university, ensuring that the dream of a fully-featured RC racing and performance outfit is never thrown to the wayside.
